Work for generating the normalized list of supported values is tracked in a separate issue. Mappings between normalized values and vendor specified values need to be explored as a part of this work. However, these mappings are not included in the spec documentation. Separate tasks will be created for making these mappings available to practitioners outside of the FOCUS repository.
