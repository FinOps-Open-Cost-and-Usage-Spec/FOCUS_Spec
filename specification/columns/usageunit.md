# Usage Unit

The Usage Unit represents a provider-specified measurement unit indicating how a provider measures usage or purchase of a given SKU associated with a [*resource*](#glossary:resource) or [*service*](#glossary:service). Usage Unit complements the [Usage Quantity](#usagequantity) metric. It is often listed at a finer granularity or over a different time interval when compared to the [Pricing Unit](#pricingunit) (complementary to [Pricing Quantity](#pricingquantity)), and focuses on *resource* and *service* consumption, not pricing and cost.

The UsageUnit column MUST be present in the billing data. This column MUST be of type String. The value MUST NOT be null if [SkuPriceId](#skupriceid) is not null and MUST be null if SkuPriceId is null. Units of measure used in UsageUnit SHOULD adhere to the values and format requirements specified in the [UnitFormat](#unitformat) attribute. The UsageUnit column MUST NOT be used to determine values related to any pricing or cost metrics.
