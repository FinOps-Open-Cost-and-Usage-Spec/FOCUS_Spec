# Billed Cost

The Billed Cost represents a charge serving as the basis for invoicing, inclusive of the impacts of all reduced rates and discounts while excluding the amortization of relevant purchases (one-time or recurring) paid to cover future eligible charges. This cost is denominated in the [Billing Currency](#billingcurrency). The Billed Cost is used to perform FinOps capabilities that require cash-basis accounting such as cost allocation, budgeting, and invoice reconciliation.

The BilledCost column MUST be present in the billing data. This column MUST be a valid numeric value of type Decimal, denominated in the BillingCurrency, and MUST NOT be null. The aggregated BilledCost for a billing period MUST match the charge received on the invoice for the same billing period.
