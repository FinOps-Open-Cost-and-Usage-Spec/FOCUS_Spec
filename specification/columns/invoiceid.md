# Invoice ID

An Invoice ID is a provider-assigned identifier for invoices and usage charges in the billing period the invoice was generated. Invoices are commonly used for scenarios like tracking billing transactions, facilitating payment processes and for permforming invoice reconcilliation between usage and invoice months. 

The Invoice ID column adheres to the following requirements:

* The Invoice ID column MUST be present in a [*FOCUS dataset*](#glossary:FOCUS-dataset).
* This column MUST be of type String and SHOULD be null if a provider does not pre-generate invoice ID's. Where a provider pre-generates an invoice ID the column MUST NOT contain null.
* Invoice ID MUST be a globally unique identifier within a provider.
