# Invoice ID

An Invoice ID is a provider-assigned identifier for an invoice encapsulating some or all charges in the corresponding billing period. Invoices are commonly used for scenarios like tracking billing transactions, facilitating payment processes and for performing invoice reconciliation between usage and invoice months. 

The Invoice ID column adheres to the following requirements:

* InvoiceId is RECOMMENDED to be present in a [*FOCUS dataset*](#glossary:FOCUS-dataset).
* Invoice ID MUST be of type string
* When an Invoice ID is not associated with a line item, invoice ID MUST be null
* When an Invoice ID is associated with a line item, invoice ID MUST NOT be null
* An invoice ID MAY be generated prior to an invoice being issued and MUST be associated with line items linked to the pre-generated invoice
