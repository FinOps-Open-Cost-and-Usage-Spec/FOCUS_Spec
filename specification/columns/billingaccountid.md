# Billing Account ID

A billing account is a container for resources and/or services that are billed together in an invoice. Billing accounts are commonly used for scenarios like grouping based on organizational constructs, invoice reconciliation and cost allocation strategies.

A Billing Account ID is a provider assigned identifier for a billing account.

The BillingAccountId column MUST be present in the billing data. This column MUST be of type String and MUST NOT contain null values. BillingAccountId MUST be a globally unique identifier within a provider.

See [Appendix: Grouping constructs for resources and/or services](#groupingconstructsforresourcesand/orservices) for details and examples of the different grouping constructs supported by FOCUS.
