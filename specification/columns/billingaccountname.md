# Billing Account Name

A billing account is a container for resources and/or services that are billed together in an invoice. Billing accounts are commonly used for scenarios like grouping based on organizational constructs, invoice reconciliation and cost allocation strategies.

A Billing Account Name is a display name assigned to a billing account.

The BillingAccountName column MUST be present in the billing data. This column MUST be of type String. The BillingAccountName MUST NOT be null if a display name can be assigned to a billing account. BillingAccountName MUST be unique within a customer when a customer has more than one billing account.

See [Appendix: Grouping constructs for resources and/or services](#groupingconstructsforresourcesand/orservices) for details and examples of the different grouping constructs supported by FOCUS.
