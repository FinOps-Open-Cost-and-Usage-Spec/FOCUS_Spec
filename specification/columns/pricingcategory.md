# Pricing Category

Pricing Category describes the pricing model used for a charge at the time of use or purchase. It can be useful for distinguishing between charges at the [List Unit Price](#ListUnitPrice) or a reduced price and exposing optimization opportunities, like increasing commitment-based discount coverage.

The PricingCategory column adheres to the following requirements:

* PricingCategory MUST be present in the billing data and MUST be of type String.
* PricingCategory MUST be null if [SkuPriceId](#skupriceid) is null and MUST NOT be null if SkuPriceId is not null.
* PricingCategory MUST be one of the allowed values.
* PricingCategory MUST be "On-Demand" when pricing is predetermined at the standard rate for the billing account.
* PricingCategory MUST be "Commitment-Based" when [CommitmentDiscountId](#commitmentdiscountid) is not null.
* PricingCategory MUST be "Dynamic" when pricing is determined by the provider and may change over time, regardless of predetermined agreement pricing.
* PricingCategory MUST be "Other" when there is a pricing model but none of the current allowed values apply.
