# Pricing Quantity

The Pricing Quantity represents the volume of a given SKU associated with a [*resource*](#glossary:resource) or [*service*](#glossary:service) used or purchased, based on the [Pricing Unit](#pricingunit). Distinct from [Consumed Quantity](#consumedquantity) (complementary to [Consumed Unit](#consumedunit)), it focuses on pricing and cost, not *resource* and *service* consumption.

The PricingQuantity column MUST be present in the billing data. This column MUST be of type Decimal and MUST conform to [Numeric Format](#numericformat) requirements. The value MAY be negative in cases where [ChargeClass](#chargeclass) is "Correction". This column MUST NOT be null when [ChargeClass](#chargeclass) is not "Correction" and [ChargeCategory](#chargecategory) is "Usage" or "Purchase", MUST be null when ChargeCategory is "Tax", and MAY be null for all other combinations of ChargeClass and ChargeCategory. When unit prices are not null, multiplying PricingQuantity by a unit price MUST produce a result equal to the corresponding cost metric, except in cases of ChargeClass "Correction", which may address PricingQuantity or any cost discrepancies independently.
