# Pricing Quantity

The Pricing Quantity represents the volume of a given SKU associated with a [*resource*](#glossary:resource) or [*service*](#glossary:service) used or purchased, based on the [Pricing Unit](#pricingunit). Distinct from [Usage Quantity](#usagequantity) (complementary to [Usage Unit](#usageunit)), it focuses on pricing and cost, not *resource* and *service* consumption.

The PricingQuantity column MUST be present in the billing data. This column MUST be of type Decimal and MUST conform to [Numeric Format](#numericformat) requirements. The value MAY be negative in cases where [ChargeSubcategory](#chargesubcategory) is "Refund". This column MUST NOT be null if [ChargeCategory](#chargecategory) is "Usage" or "Purchase" and MAY be null for other ChargeCategory values. When unit prices are not null, multiplying PricingQuantity by a unit price MUST produce a result equal to the corresponding cost metric.
