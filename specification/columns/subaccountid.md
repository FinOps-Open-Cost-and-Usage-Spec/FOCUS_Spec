# Sub Account ID

A sub account is an optional provider-supported construct for organizing resources and/or services connected to a billing account. Sub accounts are commonly used for scenarios like grouping based on organizational constructs, access management needs and cost allocation strategies. Sub accounts must be associated with a billing account as they do not receive invoices.

A sub account ID is a provider assigned identifier assigned to a sub account.

The SubAccountId column MUST be present in the billing data. This column MUST be of type String. If a provider supports a sub account construct, that value MUST appear in this column. If a provider does not support a sub account construct (only has a billing account) or does support a sub account construct, but the charge does not apply to a sub account, the SubAccountId column MUST be null.

See [Appendix: Grouping constructs for resources and/or services](#groupingconstructsforresourcesand/orservices) for details and examples of the different grouping constructs supported by FOCUS.
