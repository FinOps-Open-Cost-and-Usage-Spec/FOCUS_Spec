# Consumed Quantity

The Consumed Quantity represents the volume of a given SKU associated with a [*resource*](#glossary:resource) or [*service*](#glossary:service) used, based on the [Consumed Unit](#consumedunit). Consumed Quantity is often derived at a finer granularity or over a different time interval when compared to the [Pricing Quantity](#pricingquantity) (complementary to [Pricing Unit](#pricingunit)) and focuses on *resource* and *service* consumption, not pricing and cost.

ConsumedQuantity column MUST be present in the billing data when the provider supports the measurement of usage. This column MUST NOT be null if [ChargeCategory](#chargecategory) is "Usage" and  [ChargeClass](#chargeclass) is not "Correction". This column MUST be null for other ChargeCategory values. This column MUST be of type Decimal and MUST conform to [Numeric Format](#numericformat) requirements. The value MAY be negative in cases where [ChargeClass](#chargeclass) is "Correction".
