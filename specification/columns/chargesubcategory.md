# Charge Subcategory

Charge Subcategory indicates what kind of usage or adjustment the row represents. Charge Subcategory is a supplemental detail to the [Charge Category](#chargecategory). It provides additional context to describe the primary category of charge.

This linkage to the parent Charge Category means that for every entry under Charge Category, there can be a corresponding Charge Subcategory that further refines the nature of the charge. It's a nested level of detail that allows users to see not just what type of charge was incurred. Current sub-categorization currently applies to Charge Category values "Usage" and "Adjustment". Support for others will be added as needed.

When Charge Category is "Usage" and the charge is related to a commitment, the Charge Subcategory indicates whether the row represents committed usage or is an amortized charge for the unused portion of the commitment. Charge Subcategory is commonly used for scenarios like calculating commitment utilization when Charge Category is "Usage".

When Charge Category is "Adjustment", the Charge Subcategory indicates what kind of after-the-fact adjustment the record represents and is commonly used to identify changes like credits and refunds.

ChargeSubcategory MUST follow the requirements listed below:

* The ChargeSubcategory MUST be present in the billing data.
* ChargeSubcategory is of type String and MUST be one of the allowed values.
* ChargeSubcategory MUST NOT be null when ChargeCategory is "Usage" and the charge is covered by a commitment.
  * When a usage charge is covered by a commitment, ChargeSubcategory MUST be "Used Commitment".
  * When a commitment is not used fully used or partially used within the committed period, ChargeSubcategory MUST be "Unused Commitment" for the unused usage charge.
* ChargeSubcategory MUST be null when ChargeCategory is "Usage" and is not covered by a commitment.
* ChargeSubcategory MUST NOT be null when ChargeCategory is "Adjustment".
  * When an adjustment applies to a specific item, the corresponding FOCUS columns that identify that item MUST NOT be null and MUST match the applicable item details the adjustment pertains to.
* ChargeSubcategory MUST be null when ChargeCategory is "Purchase" or "Tax".
