# List Cost

List Cost represents the cost calculated by multiplying the [*list unit price*](#glossary:list-unit-price) and the corresponding [Pricing Quantity](#pricingquantity). List Cost is denominated in the [Billing Currency](#billingcurrency) and is commonly used for calculating savings based on various rate optimization activities, by comparing it with [Billed Cost](#billedcost) and [Effective Cost](#effectivecost).

The ListCost column MUST be present in the billing data and MUST NOT be null. This column MUST be of type Decimal, MUST conform to [Numeric Format](#numericformat) requirements, and be denominated in the BillingCurrency. When [ListUnitPrice](#listunitprice) is present and not null, multiplying the ListUnitPrice by PricingQuantity MUST produce the ListCost.

In cases where the ListUnitPrice is present and is null, the following applies:

* The ListCost of a charge calculated based on other charges (e.g., when the [ChargeCategory](#chargecategory) is "Tax") MUST be calculated based on the ListCost of those related charges.
* The ListCost of a charge unrelated to other charges (e.g., when the [ChargeSubcategory](#chargesubcategory) is "Credit") MUST match the [BilledCost](#billedcost).
