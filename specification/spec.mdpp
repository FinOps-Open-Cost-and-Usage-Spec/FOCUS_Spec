## Abstract

FOCUS is an open-source specification for cloud billing data. It defines a common schema for billing data, aligns terminology with the FinOps Framework and defines a minimum set of requirements for billing data. The specification provides clear guideline for billing data generators to produce FinOps-serviceable data. The specification enables FinOps practitioners to perform common FinOps capabilities such as chargeback, cost allocation, budgeting and forecasting etc. using a generic set of instructions, regardless of the origin of the FOCUS compatible dataset.
