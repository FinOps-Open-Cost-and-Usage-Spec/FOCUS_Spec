# Billed Cost

The billed cost represents a charge inclusive of negotiated discounts that a consumer would be charged for each billing period. Billed cost does not amortize upfront charges (one-time or recurring). Billed cost is often used to perform FinOps capabilities that require cash-basis accounting such as cost allocation, budgeting, and invoice reconciliation.
