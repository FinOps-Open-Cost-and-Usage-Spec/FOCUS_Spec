# Metrics

The FOCUS specification defines a group of columns that provide numeric values. These columns are categorized to as
'metrics' within the dataset and are needed to serve many [FinOps capabilities][FODOFC]. Metric columns in the dataset
allow for aggregation operations such as arithmetic operations (sum, multiplication, averaging etc.) and statistical
operations. When combined with dimensions (which are qualitative value columns), metrics reveal details in your data.
