# Dimensions

The FOCUS specification defines a group of columns that provide qualitative values (such as dates, resource, and provider information). These
columns are categorized to as 'dimensions' within the dataset and are needed to serve many [FinOps capabilities][FODOFC]. You can use
dimensions to categorize, filter, and reveal details in your data when grouped with 'metrics', which are the quantitative (numeric) values.
