# Sub Account Name

A sub account is an optional provider-supported construct for organizing resources and services connected to a billing account. Some common scenarios for using sub accounts include grouping based on organizational constructs and access management boundaries. Sub accounts must be associated with a billing account as they do not receive invoices.

A sub account name is a display name assigned to a sub account. It is commonly used for cost allocation, reporting, and chargeback purposes.

The SubAccountName column MUST be present in the billing data. This column MUST be of type String and SHOULD NOT contain null values. If a provider doesn't support a sub account construct (only has a billing account), use the BillingAccountName value. If a provider does support a sub account construct, but the charge does not apply to a sub account, the SubAccountName column may be null.
