# Charge Type

A Charge Type indicates whether the record represents an upfront or recurring fee, cost of usage that already occurred,
an after-the-fact adjustment (e.g., credits), or taxes. The Charge Type is commonly used to identify prepaid purchases
separately from usage-based charges, to separate taxes that may require special handling, or to apply finer-grained
allocation logic to purchases or adjustments.

The ChargeType column MUST be present and MUST NOT be null or empty. This column is of type String and MUST be one of the
allowed values.
