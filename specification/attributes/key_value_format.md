# Key-Value Format

Columns that provide Key-Value information are often used in place of separate columns for enumerating data which would be inherently sparse and/or without predetermined keys. This consolidates related information and provides more consistency in the schema. Key-value pairs are also referred to as name-value pairs, attribute-value pairs, or field-value pairs.

All key-value related columns defined in the [FOCUS](#glossary:finops-cost-and-usage-specification) specification MUST follow the key-value formatting requirements listed below.
