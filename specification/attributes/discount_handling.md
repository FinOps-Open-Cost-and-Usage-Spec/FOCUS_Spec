# Amortization Handling

Amortization is a process used to break down and spread purchase costs over the period of time or term of use. 

Amortization is primarily used in purchasable commitment-based discounts. When a purchase is applicable to resources, like commitment-based discounts, the amortized cost of a resource takes the initial payment and term into account and distributes it out based on the resource's usage, attributing the prorated cost for each hour of billing. Amortization provides a method for FinOps practitioners to reallocate purchase charges to the appropriate audience in support of their cost allocation efforts.
