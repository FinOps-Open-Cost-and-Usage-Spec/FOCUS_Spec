# Introduction

The FOCUS specification's metadata specification provides a common, provider-neutral metadata repository. This metadata provides practitioners information on the schema of FOCUS data, and general information about the FOCUS data.


## Logical Sections

FOCUS metadata is organized in logical sections. Each logical section is organized to provide functional groupings of metadata. 

### Provider 
This section provides metadata about the provider of the FOCUS data.
See:[Metadata Generator](metadata_generatorprovider.md)

### Schema
This section provides metadata about the schemas of the FOCUS data. The schemas section provides a list of the schemas used and a column definition of those schemas. 
See:[Metadata Schema](metadata_schema.md)


## Example Methods of Delivery

Because methods of delivery of FOCUS differ by provider, the metadata specification includes examples of how metadata may be provided.
