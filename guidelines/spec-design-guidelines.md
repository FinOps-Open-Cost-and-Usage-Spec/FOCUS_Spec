Guidelines for Specification Design
-----------------------------------

When designing and creating the document for the specification, the following guidelines should be adhered to.

Specification Content
---------------------

The specification:
* must not specify that a specific technology, software package/library, or cloud provider must be (or is recommended to be) used
* can use examples that show a specific technology, software package/library, or cloud provider to demonstrate a concept
* should use lots of figures and examples to help visualize the content of the specification
* must keep figures and examples close to the normative prose
* must not rely on figures to define the specification, normative prose is always required to make precise specifications


Document Design
--------------

The specification content:
* must have a Table of Contents which makes sense and the ordering of content should be sensical, headings should help people identify the section they are looking for
* must be written with an overall model before digging into the details. Each section will start with an overview of the feature and description
* should be written in order, so when read top to bottom any referenced content has already been covered in a previous section

Some of these items have been formed based on this W3C video on [Best Practices for Editing W3C Specifications](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdB8mqlf1l8)
