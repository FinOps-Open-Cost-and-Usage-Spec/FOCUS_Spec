## Discussion / Scratch space

- What are the different types of spend that we want to group?
- This work is to group the different values providers use to differentiate the spend. The plan is to introduce a ‘normalized’ dimension for this in v1.0
  - Should this be prefixed with ‘Provider’ since we want to normalize this as well? If not, we have to come up with another name for the normalized column
    - Decided that this should be a normalized column from v0.5.
    - Given the mis-alignment of current vendor data, its not going to be much value to create a dimension where we put different vendor values in a single column so practitioners can use the vendor provided value using a single column rather than doing n different where clauses when looking for the vendor native value (not our normalized value).
- This dimension may be referred to in other contexts - e.g. data granularity requirements (attribute) may change based on if its usage data vs tax or fees. For example, Should ResourceId be required based on if something is a ‘usage’ cost vs a ‘purchase’?
- Use cases:
  - Usage for cost reporting use cases / driving accountability
  - Tax needs to be filterable for special accounting treatments within companies
  - Fees are important for cost allocation / amortization - needs to be isolated from other cost
  - Refunds - $s coming back after the original charge
  - Credits are typically based on agreements for migration of workloads
  - AWS handling for SPs: Anniversary charge (BillType) Savings Plan for $1 and a negation for UsageType (for -0.50)
- Is it Recurring or not? (Attribute about the Purchase?)
- What Charge Types can BE recurring?
- What Charge Types for "Free Tier" with usage limits and "Free Trial" offers?
