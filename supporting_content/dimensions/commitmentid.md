## Discussion / Scratch space:

GCP mapping in case of a reseller:

Quotes from GCP documentation:

- [Structure of Detailed data export | Cloud Billing](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/export-data-bigquery-tables/detailed-usage): "billing_account_id: ... For resellers: For usage costs generated by a Cloud Billing subaccount, this is the ID of the subaccount, not the ID of the parent reseller Cloud Billing account..."
- [About Cloud Billing](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/concepts#subaccounts): "...Cloud Billing subaccounts allow you to group charges from projects together on a separate section of your invoice. A billing subaccount is a Cloud Billing account that is owned by a reseller's parent Cloud Billing account. The usage charges for all billing subaccounts are paid for by the reseller's parent Cloud Billing account..."

I have no experience with GCP reseller UC, but I assume you should/could use [REST Resource: billingAccounts | Cloud Billing](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/reference/rest/v1/billingAccounts) in order to resolve the Parent Billing account ID for Provider mapping?!
