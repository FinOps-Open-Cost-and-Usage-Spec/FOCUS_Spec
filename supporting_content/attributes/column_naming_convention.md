# Column naming convention

## Example provider mappings

Examples of column names found in provider datasets:

| Provider  | Data set                 | Column                |
|-----------|--------------------------|-----------------------|
| AWS       | CUR                      | bill_invoicing_entity |
| GCP       | Big Query Billing Export | resource.global_name  |
| Microsoft | Cost details             | ResourceId            |

- Group wanted to get naming convention adopted broadly for provider columns as well, to simplify reporting and analysis by practitioners
- Different conventions like camel case, snake case, and title case were considered
