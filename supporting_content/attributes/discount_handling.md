# Discussion / Scratch space

- AWS discount types include:
  - DiscountedUsage - discounts covered by Reserved Instances
  - SavingsPlanCoveredUsage - discounts covered by SavingsPlans
  - EdpDiscount - Enterprise Discount Program
  - SppDiscount - Solutions Provider Program
  - RiVolumeDiscount
  - BundledDiscount - discounted usage on a specific product/service based on the usage of another product/service.

- GCP discount types include:

  - COMMITTED_USAGE_DISCOUNT_DOLLAR_BASE - Spend-based commitment discounts.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Sustained Use Discounts (SUDs) are handled as after-the-fact adjustments (aka credits) and do not apply to the Discount Handling attribute since this attribute requires that discounts be applied directly to the row they're discounting.
  - FREE_TIER - free resource usage up to specified limits.

  - RESELLER_MARGIN - indicates the Reseller Program Discounts earned on every eligible line item.
  - SUBSCRIPTION_BENEFIT - credits earned by purchasing long-term subscriptions to services in exchange for discounts.

- Where does spot instance usage-based discount fall under? Should there be a **Usage-based discounts** type?

- Where does GCP's sustained usage discount fall under? Maybe the same as spot instance, in which case, **Usage-based discounts**?

  - Azure Hybrid Benefit
