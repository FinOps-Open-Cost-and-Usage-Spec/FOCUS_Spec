## Discussion / Scratch space

Product Category should align to the same principles as Service Category. They are synonymous in terms of categorization and only differ in that a product is often used as part of a larger service.

In reference to Service Category, we provide an example of how resources under the Databases service category may have storage and compute costs. Those storage and compute costs, while separate from the service category, would be tracked as a product category, where the compute usage and storage usage are separate products being used as part of the larger database service.
