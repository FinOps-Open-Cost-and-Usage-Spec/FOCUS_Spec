# Column: ListUnitPrice

## Example provider mappings

Current column mappings found in available data sets:

| Provider  | Data set                     | Column                   |
|:----------|:-----------------------------|:-------------------------|
| AWS       | CUR;<br>AWS Price List API   | pricing/publicOnDemandRate: The public On-Demand Instance rate in this billing period for the specific line item of usage. If you have SKUs with multiple On-Demand public rates, the equivalent rate for the highest tier is displayed. For example, services offering free-tiers or tiered pricing.<br>*Note: Since currently only pricing/publicOnDemandRate definition includes note regarding highest tier, I'm not sure if volume-based pricing applies to all unit prices (rates) in CUR files. If it's not consistent, we might have to rely on the AWS Price List API.* |
| GCP       | BigQuery Pricing Data Export;<br>Cloud Billing API | Not available in BigQuery Billing Export but can be resolved from both the list_price Struct in BigQuery Pricing Data Export and the Cloud Billing API |
| Microsoft | Cost details;<br>Azure Retail Prices REST API | pay-as-you-goPrice/PayGPrice: Retail price for the resource<br>*Note: Identified some discrepancy between the value in Cost details and the Retail Price obtained from the Azure Retail Prices REST API, particularly in the context of CSPs. Might be related to Partner Billing UC?* |
| OCI       | List Pricing REST API        | Not available in Cost and Usage Report but can be resolved from the List Pricing REST API |

## Discussion / Scratch space

### Current data sources

- While Microsoft and AWS offer candidate columns for mapping to ListUnitPrice within billing data, relying on pricing data for all providers is advisable due to mentioned discrepancies and volume/tier-based pricing concerns. Filtering pricing data based on resolved billing data to identify that specific list unit price is possible but often presents a challenge, particularly with volume/tier-based prices.
- MSFT lists the Retail Price as well as the Unit Price.

### Prices and Currencies

- We deliberated on whether to specify both BillingCurrency and PricingCurrency and decided to enforce a single currency, specifically BillingCurrency. This approach provides consistency and simplifies invoice reconciliation. Since some providers don't include List Unit Prices in BillingCurrency in their public price sheets, the inclusion of a CurrencyExchangeRate dimension in the billing data becomes imperative (name subject to change). This is necessary to ensure we can accurately compare and match ListUnitPrices provided in billing data with those published in public price sheets.

### Naming challenges

Two naming challenges were resolved through polls, giving signed members the chance to voice their preferences.

- POLL 1: Please select the term you prefer to use when referring to the published rate and corresponding cost without any discounts:
  - Retail - 3 votes
  - List - 13 votes
  - Market - 1 vote
  - PAYG - 1 vote
  - Public - 5 votes
- POLL 2: Please select the term you prefer to use when referring to the price for a single unit of measure:
  - Rate - 2 votes
  - Unit Price - 13 votes
  - Price - 2 votes

The following dimensions and metrics names were influenced by these decisions:

- List Cost
- Billed Unit Price
- Negotiated Unit Price
- List Unit Price
